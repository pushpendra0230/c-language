swap:-
q.1
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int a =56; 
	int b = 89;
	int c;
	printf("the value of a is :%d\n",a);
	printf("the value of b is :%d\n",b);
	c=a;
	a=b;
	b=c;
	printf("the swap value of a is :%d\n",a);
	printf("the swap value of b is :%d\n",b);
	return 0;
}
output:-
the value of a is :56
the value of b is :89
the swap value of a is :89
the swap value of b is :56
